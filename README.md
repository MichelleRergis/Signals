# Analysis of Signals and Systems
##**Design of a Biometric System to Process Voice Signals**
##Introduction

Voice is the primary element of communication for human beings. Since the first forms of speeches emerged over 20,000 years ago, it has been the medium through which people interact with the world. Voice is the speaker’s main emblem, a fingerprint with unique characteristics. Consequently, voice processing systems (VPS) have become increasingly prevalent. These systems have evolved from simple search interfaces to systems capable of understanding and responding to natural language (Ganchev, 2024). 

The present work focuses on developing a voice processing system in MATLAB. The objective is to create an algorithm that identifies a particular voice through statistical analysis of distinguishable vocal characteristics. For this purpose, voice samples of a specific subject were taken in different contexts—speaking loudly, with the microphone at a distance, and in noisy environments. Correspondingly, samples for other voices were also taken. These signals were processed statistically to create a profile unique to the subject’s voice. 
A total of 20 voice samples were taken from the subject. The dialogue “I told you I don’t want to join your super-secret boyband” from Marvel Studios’ Iron Man 2 serves as the sample phrase.
